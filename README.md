Analog Filter Design

The name "filgen" is from "filter generation." 

I intend this repository to hold documentation, code, explorations (or whatever you want to call it) in the field of analog filter design. I've mainly used m-code (Octave) for exploration because the syntax of that language is unquestionably easiest for idea exploration. I've also used Python.
